# Hi there I'm Rasha👋 ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/rasha-%3Ctryin--to--figure--out--my--codes%2F%3E-red)

### I am a passionate coder and a researcher. I enjoy using my skills to present myself in hackathons and other similar events. I love to collaborate with people around the world on projects and moreover discuss and get my hands dirty on the emerging and new technology.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on myself!
- 🌱 Prolly a self taught programmer who messes up stuffs at all phases
- 🤷‍♂️ All my codes are absolute trash but anyways they're flexible enough to solve the problems 
- 💬 I'm probably stuck between the passion and profession phase of coding
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like people who laugh at my lame jokes and love hearing me blabbering 24x7
